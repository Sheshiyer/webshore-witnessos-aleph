# WitnessOS PROJECT MEMORY

## Overview
WitnessOS is a consciousness exploration platform with 10 consciousness engines (Biorhythm, I Ching, Tarot, Numerology, Human Design, Vimshottari, Enneagram, Sacred Geometry, Gene Keys, Sigil Forge). The system uses a hybrid architecture with Cloudflare Workers for the frontend API and a Python backend on Railway for engine calculations.

## Key Breakthroughs

### Hybrid Architecture Success
- **Discovery**: Cloudflare Workers + Railway Python backend architecture is operational
- **Evidence**: All 10 engines working with real calculations
- **Impact**: Validates the technical approach for complete system integration

### Direct API Integration Pattern
- **Discovery**: Bypassing src/engines/index.ts and calling Railway directly is the correct approach
- **Evidence**: calculateEngine function explicitly throws errors, forcing direct API calls
- **Impact**: Clear implementation pattern for all engine integrations

## Error Patterns & Solutions

### calculateEngine Function Issues
- **Problem**: src/engines/index.ts calculateEngine function throws errors when called directly
- **Root Cause**: Designed to force routing through Cloudflare Workers to Python backend
- **Solution**: Use direct HTTP calls to Railway backend via fetch()
- **Pattern**: All engine calculations must use https://webshore-witnessos-aleph-production.up.railway.app/engines/{engineName}/calculate

### Missing Endpoint Integration
- **Problem**: Frontend expects metadata endpoints that weren't implemented
- **Root Cause**: Incomplete endpoint mapping between frontend expectations and backend reality
- **Solution**: Systematic endpoint mapping and implementation across all layers
- **Pattern**: Check enhanced-api-router.ts → engine-proxy-worker.ts → Railway app.py for complete flow

## Architecture Decisions

### Engine Calculation Flow
1. Frontend → Cloudflare Workers (enhanced-api-router.ts)
2. Workers → Engine Proxy (engine-proxy-worker.ts) 
3. Proxy → Railway Python Backend (app.py)
4. Response flows back through the same chain

### Authentication Integration
- JWT tokens validated at Cloudflare Worker level
- User authentication required for engine calculations
- Tiered access control implemented (Tier 1+2 required for engines)

### Current Engine Status
- **Working (10/10)**: All engines now working with real calculations ✅
  - Biorhythm, I Ching, Tarot, Numerology, Human Design, Vimshottari, Enneagram, Sacred Geometry, Gene Keys, Sigil Forge
- All engines properly routed through enhanced-api-router.ts → engine-proxy-worker.ts → Railway Python backend
- Both test-index.ts and enhanced-api-router.ts using real Railway calculations

## Next Dependencies
- **Frontend Integration:** Connect engine components and forecast displays to real API
- **Reading History Management:** Complete reading CRUD operations with correlation analysis
- **Advanced Caching:** Sophisticated caching with confidence-based TTL
- **Performance Monitoring:** Real-time performance metrics and dashboard
