## üéØ Core Components

### 1. Engine Orchestrator (`orchestrator.py`)

Coordinates multiple divination engines for comprehensive readings.

**Key Features:**
- Parallel and sequential engine execution
- Thread pool optimization (configurable workers)
- Engine caching and lifecycle management
- Comprehensive error handling
- Performance monitoring

**Usage:**
```python
from ENGINES.integration.orchestrator import EngineOrchestrator

orchestrator = EngineOrchestrator(max_workers=4)

# Run single engine
result = orchestrator.run_single_engine('numerology', input_data)

# Run multiple engines in parallel
engine_configs = [
    {'name': 'numerology', 'input': birth_data},
    {'name': 'biorhythm', 'input': birth_data}
]
results = orchestrator.run_parallel_engines(engine_configs)

# Create comprehensive reading
reading = orchestrator.create_comprehensive_reading(birth_data)
```

### 2. Result Synthesizer (`synthesis.py`)

Analyzes patterns across different divination systems and creates unified insights.

**Key Features:**
- Cross-engine correlation analysis
- Numerical pattern recognition
- Archetypal theme extraction
- Temporal alignment detection
- Energy signature analysis
- Reality patch generation

**Analysis Types:**
- **Numerical Correlations**: Repeated numbers across systems
- **Archetypal Resonance**: Common themes and archetypes
- **Temporal Alignments**: Timing patterns and cycles
- **Energy Signatures**: Flow patterns and blockages

**Usage:**
```python
from ENGINES.integration.synthesis import ResultSynthesizer

synthesizer = ResultSynthesizer()
synthesis = synthesizer.synthesize_reading(engine_results)

# Access correlations
correlations = synthesis['correlations']
unified_themes = synthesis['unified_themes']
reality_patches = synthesis['reality_patches']
```

### 3. Workflow Manager (`workflows.py`)

Provides predefined workflow patterns for common reading scenarios.

**Available Workflows:**
- `complete_natal`: Comprehensive natal chart analysis
- `relationship_compatibility`: Two-person compatibility analysis
- `career_guidance`: Career and life purpose guidance
- `spiritual_development`: Consciousness evolution guidance
- `life_transition`: Major life transition support
- `daily_guidance`: Daily energy optimization
- `shadow_work`: Shadow integration and healing
- `manifestation_timing`: Optimal timing for manifestation

**Usage:**
```python
from ENGINES.integration.workflows import WorkflowManager

workflow_manager = WorkflowManager()

# List available workflows
workflows = workflow_manager.get_available_workflows()

# Run a workflow
result = workflow_manager.run_workflow(
    'complete_natal', 
    birth_data, 
    {'include_divination': True}
)
```

### 4. Field Analyzer (`field_analyzer.py`)

Analyzes consciousness field signatures and provides reality optimization suggestions.

**Key Features:**
- Field coherence calculation
- Dominant frequency identification
- Harmonic pattern analysis
- Interference zone detection
- Consciousness level assessment
- Evolution vector calculation
- Reality patch generation

**Field Metrics:**
- **Coherence**: Overall field alignment and consistency
- **Stability**: Field stability and volatility indicators
- **Consciousness Level**: Current awareness and integration degree
- **Evolution Vector**: Direction and velocity of consciousness evolution

**Usage:**
```python
from ENGINES.integration.field_analyzer import FieldAnalyzer

field_analyzer = FieldAnalyzer()
field_signature = field_analyzer.analyze_field_signature(engine_results)

# Access field metrics
coherence = field_signature['field_coherence']
consciousness_level = field_signature['consciousness_level']
reality_patches = field_signature['reality_patches']
```

## üåä Workflow Examples

### Complete Natal Reading
```python
# Initialize components
orchestrator = EngineOrchestrator()
workflow_manager = WorkflowManager()

# Birth data
birth_data = {
    'name': 'John Doe',
    'date': '01.01.1990',
    'time': '12:00',
    'location': 'New York, NY'
}

# Run complete natal workflow
result = workflow_manager.run_workflow('complete_natal', birth_data)

# Access results
engine_results = result['engine_results']
synthesis = result['synthesis']
recommendations = result['recommendations']
```

### Custom Multi-Engine Reading
```python
# Define custom engine combination
engines = ['numerology', 'human_design', 'gene_keys', 'vimshottari']

# Create comprehensive reading
reading = orchestrator.create_comprehensive_reading(birth_data, engines)

# Synthesize results
synthesizer = ResultSynthesizer()
synthesis = synthesizer.synthesize_reading(reading['results'])

# Analyze consciousness field
field_analyzer = FieldAnalyzer()
field_signature = field_analyzer.analyze_field_signature(reading['results'])
```

## üîß Configuration

### Orchestrator Configuration
```python
orchestrator = EngineOrchestrator(
    max_workers=4,  # Number of parallel workers
)
```

### Workflow Options
```python
options = {
    'include_divination': True,     # Include tarot/i-ching
    'analysis_depth': 'deep',       # basic, standard, deep
    'format': 'witnessOS'           # standard, mystical, witnessOS
