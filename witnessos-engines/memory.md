## Architecture Decisions
- **Keep Cloudflare Workers**: Enhanced API router, engine service worker, and other orchestration workers remain
- **Remove TypeScript Engines**: All engine calculation logic moved to Python on Railway
- **Maintain API Compatibility**: External API endpoints remain unchanged
- **Preserve Types**: Keep necessary type definitions for API contracts
