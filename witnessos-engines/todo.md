# PROJECT TODO - HYBRID ARCHITECTURE PIVOT

## In Progress

## Pending
- [ ] Fix remaining TypeScript compilation errors (600+ errors across multiple files)
- [ ] Update type definitions and imports throughout the codebase
- [ ] Resolve API handler and worker type mismatches
- [ ] Clean up engine types that are no longer needed
- [ ] Update validation constants to remove TypeScript engine references
