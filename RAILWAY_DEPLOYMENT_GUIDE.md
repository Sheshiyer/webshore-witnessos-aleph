## Current Issue: Railway Serving Default Page Instead of FastAPI App

### Problem Description
Railway is successfully building and starting our service internally, but serving a default "Home of the Railway API" placeholder page instead of our FastAPI application. All consciousness engines are operational internally (confirmed by logs), but external routing is not working.

### Symptoms
- ‚úÖ Railway service shows as "Running" 
- ‚úÖ Build logs show successful dependency installation
- ‚úÖ Application logs show all 12 engines initializing successfully
- ‚úÖ Swiss Ephemeris calculations working (Gate 4.1, Gate 2.6)
- ‚ùå External URLs return Railway's default page instead of our FastAPI app
- ‚ùå All API endpoints return 404 "Not Found"

## üîß Manual Railway Dashboard Fix Steps

### Step 1: Access Railway Dashboard
1. Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Log in to your account
3. Navigate to the `witnessos-engines-production` project
4. Click on the service deployment

### Step 2: Verify Repository Connection
1. **Check Source**: Ensure connected to correct GitHub repository
   - Repository: `Sheshiyer/webshore-witnessos-aleph`
   - Branch: `main`
   - Root Directory: `witnessos-engines/` (if needed)

### Step 3: Configure Build Settings
1. **Navigate to Settings ‚Üí Build**
2. **Build Command**: 
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Install Command** (if separate field):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Step 4: Configure Deploy Settings
1. **Navigate to Settings ‚Üí Deploy**
2. **Start Command**:
   ```bash
   uvicorn app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT
   ```
3. **Health Check Path**: `/health`
4. **Health Check Timeout**: `300` seconds

### Step 5: Environment Variables
1. **Navigate to Settings ‚Üí Variables**
2. **Required Variables**:
   ```
   PORT=8080
   PYTHONPATH=/app
   ```
3. **Optional Variables** (for debugging):
   ```
   PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1
   LOG_LEVEL=INFO
   ```

### Step 6: Domain Configuration
1. **Navigate to Settings ‚Üí Domains**
2. **Verify Custom Domain**: `witnessos-engines-production.up.railway.app`
3. **Check SSL Certificate**: Should be active
4. **Test Alternative Domains**:
   - `witnessos-engines.railway.app`
   - `witnessos-engines-production.railway.app`

### Step 7: Trigger Manual Deployment
1. **Navigate to Deployments tab**
2. **Click "Deploy Latest Commit"** or **"Redeploy"**
3. **Monitor Build Logs** for errors
4. **Monitor Runtime Logs** for startup confirmation

## üîç Troubleshooting Checklist

### Build Issues
- [ ] All dependencies in `requirements.txt` installing successfully
- [ ] No compilation errors (especially `pyswisseph`, `pydantic-core`)
- [ ] Python version compatibility (3.8+)

### Runtime Issues
- [ ] FastAPI app object properly exposed as `app` in `app.py`
- [ ] Port binding to `$PORT` environment variable
- [ ] Host binding to `0.0.0.0` (not `localhost` or `127.0.0.1`)
- [ ] No import errors in application startup

### Routing Issues
- [ ] Service properly exposed on Railway's proxy
- [ ] Health check endpoint responding
- [ ] Custom domain properly configured
- [ ] SSL certificate active

### Configuration Files
- [ ] `Procfile`: `web: uvicorn app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT`
- [ ] `railway.json`: Proper start command configuration
- [ ] `requirements.txt`: All dependencies listed

## üß™ Validation Tests

### After Configuration Changes
1. **Wait 2-3 minutes** for deployment to complete
2. **Test Health Endpoint**:
   ```bash
   curl https://witnessos-engines-production.up.railway.app/health
   ```
   Expected: JSON response with service status

3. **Test Root Endpoint**:
   ```bash
   curl https://witnessos-engines-production.up.railway.app/
   ```
   Expected: JSON response with service info and available engines

4. **Test Engine Calculation**:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST https://witnessos-engines-production.up.railway.app/engines/numerology/calculate \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"input":{"birth_date":"1991-08-13","full_name":"Test User"}}'
   ```
   Expected: JSON response with numerology calculation results
