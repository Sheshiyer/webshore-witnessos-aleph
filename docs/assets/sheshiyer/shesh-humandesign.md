# Design Variables Report (PRL → DRL)

## Variables Overview

- **Mind:** Right, contemplative. Waiting for opportunities.
- **Perspective:** Left, active. Focused vision.
- **Brain & Body:** Right. Receptive nervous system.
- **Environment:** Left, active. You need a stimulating environment.

## Brief Report on the PRL → DRL Variable

You have a passive and contemplative mind, but you look at things realistically and “soberly” evaluate your position in life. When you are surrounded by the right people for you, you tend to focus on actively seeking out opportunities for personal growth.

You have an active and focused vision of space. This means that such a person needs to focus on something specific, no matter what—a vision needs something to dwell on to begin perceiving in a correct way.

The Design Variables in your chart have the opposite direction—you have a passive body that is comfortable in an active environment. You can get deeply involved in a subject and remain committed to what is going on. Such behavior is natural for you.

The right brain is receptive and passive, oriented to store information rather than to create structure and strategic direction of attention. For it to function properly, you just need proper nutrition, as physical activity brings little benefit to this aspect of your body.
