# PROJECT MEMORY

## Overview
Successful implementation of precise Human Design astronomical calculations in TypeScript using Swiss Ephemeris, replacing mock calculations with real astronomical data for accurate Human Design chart generation.

## Completed Tasks

### [2025-07-11] Task Completed: Human Design Swiss Ephemeris Integration
- **Outcome**: Complete replacement of mock Human Design calculations with precise astronomical calculations using Swiss Ephemeris
- **Breakthrough**: Successfully integrated `sweph` library with TypeScript, implementing the critical 88-degree solar arc calculation for Design time
- **Errors Fixed**: 
  - Fixed sweph library API usage (data array structure vs direct properties)
  - Corrected input validation format (birthLocation as [lat, lon] array)
  - Resolved Swiss Ephemeris constants not being exported properly
- **Code Changes**: 
  - Created `astrology-calculator.ts` with AstrologyCalculator class
  - Created `human-design-calculator.ts` with HumanDesignCalculator class
  - Updated `human-design-engine.ts` to use precise calculations
  - Added comprehensive test files for validation
- **Next Dependencies**: Ready for production use, enables accurate Human Design readings

## Key Breakthroughs

### Swiss Ephemeris Integration
- Successfully integrated `sweph@2.10.3-b-1` library for astronomical calculations
- Implemented proper API usage with hardcoded constants due to export issues
- Created robust error handling and fallback mechanisms

### 88-Degree Solar Arc Calculation
- Implemented precise binary search algorithm for finding Design time
- Achieved astronomical accuracy for the critical 88-degree solar arc
- Validated against expected Human Design calculation methods

### Complete Human Design Chart Generation
- Personality and Design gate calculations for all 13 planetary positions
- Center definition analysis (9 centers with defined/undefined states)
- Channel identification and incarnation cross determination
- Type, strategy, authority, and profile calculations

### Data Structure Compatibility
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing engine interfaces
- Created conversion methods between precise and legacy formats
- Preserved all existing interpretation and recommendation logic

## Error Patterns & Solutions

### Swiss Ephemeris API Issues
- **Problem**: Constants not exported properly from sweph library
- **Solution**: Hardcoded constants based on Swiss Ephemeris documentation
- **Pattern**: Always verify library exports and have fallback constants

### Data Structure Mismatches
- **Problem**: sweph returns data in array format, not direct properties
- **Solution**: Extract values from result.data array (longitude = data[0], etc.)
- **Pattern**: Always check actual API response structure in tests

### Input Validation Failures
- **Problem**: Engine expected [lat, lon] array but received object
- **Solution**: Updated test to use correct array format for birthLocation
- **Pattern**: Verify type definitions match actual implementation expectations

## Architecture Decisions

### Modular Calculator Design
- Separated astronomical calculations (AstrologyCalculator) from Human Design logic (HumanDesignCalculator)
- Enables reuse of astronomical calculations for other engines
- Maintains clear separation of concerns

### Legacy Compatibility Layer
- Preserved existing HumanDesignEngine interface
- Created conversion methods for data format compatibility
- Allows gradual migration without breaking existing code

### Error Handling Strategy
- Comprehensive coordinate validation
- Graceful fallbacks for calculation failures
- Detailed error messages for debugging

### Testing Approach
- Created separate tests for astronomical calculations and engine integration
- Validated against known good data points
- Comprehensive coverage of edge cases and error conditions

## Technical Implementation Details

### Files Created/Modified
- `src/engines/calculators/astrology-calculator.ts` - Core astronomical calculations
- `src/engines/calculators/human-design-calculator.ts` - Human Design specific logic
- `src/engines/human-design-engine.ts` - Updated to use precise calculations
- `test-astrology.js` - Astronomical calculation tests
- `test-human-design-engine.js` - End-to-end engine tests
- `package.json` - Added sweph dependency

### Key Functions Implemented
- `dateToJulianDay()` / `julianDayToDate()` - Date conversions
- `calculatePlanetaryPositions()` - All planetary positions
- `calculateDesignTime()` - 88-degree solar arc with binary search
- `longitudeToGate()` - Longitude to Human Design gate mapping
- `calculateChart()` - Complete Human Design chart generation

### Validation Results
- All astronomical calculations working correctly
- Personality and Design gates calculated accurately
- Centers, channels, and incarnation cross determined properly
- Type analysis (Manifesting Generator) correctly identified
- Profile and strategy guidance generated successfully

## Performance Characteristics
- Uses Moshier ephemeris (built-in, no external files required)
- Fast calculation times suitable for real-time use
- Memory efficient with proper cleanup methods
- Scalable for multiple concurrent calculations

## Future Enhancements Ready
- Swiss Ephemeris data files for higher precision
- Additional Human Design features (variables, etc.)
- Performance optimizations for high-volume usage
- Extended test coverage for edge cases

### [2025-07-14] Task Completed: Tiered Onboarding System Implementation
- **Outcome**: Complete implementation of 3-tier progressive onboarding system with engine access control
- **Breakthrough**: Successfully implemented tiered data collection without affecting normal user login flows
- **Architecture**:
  - **Tier 1**: Authentication & Basic Profile (name, email, password) - auto-complete on registration
  - **Tier 2**: Birth Data (DOB, time, location coordinates, timezone) - required for engine access
  - **Tier 3**: Preferences (card selection, direction, other preferences) - completes full onboarding
- **API Endpoints Created**:
  - `POST /api/onboarding/tier1` - Complete basic profile
  - `POST /api/onboarding/tier2` - Add birth data (unlocks engines)
  - `POST /api/onboarding/tier3` - Set preferences (completes onboarding)
  - `GET /api/onboarding/status` - Get current onboarding progress
- **Engine Access Control**: Engines blocked until Tier 1 + Tier 2 completed with clear error messages
- **Backward Compatibility**: All existing authentication flows continue to work unchanged
- **Admin User Configuration**:
  - Complete profile with direction: "east", card: "alchemist"
  - All tiers completed with full engine access
  - Birth data: 13 Aug 1991, 13:31, Bengaluru India (12.9629°N, 77.5775°E)
- **Database Strategy**: Tier completion flags stored in preferences field for compatibility
- **Testing**: Comprehensive validation of all authentication flows, engine access control, and tier progression
- **Production Status**: ✅ Deployed and fully functional on https://api.witnessos.space
- **Next Dependencies**: Frontend UI implementation for progressive onboarding flow
