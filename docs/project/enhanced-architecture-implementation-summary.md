- **Enhanced error handling** across all services
- **Automatic retry logic** with exponential backoff

### ✅ Phase 5: Migration & Legacy Removal
**Complete Architecture Switch:**
- **Worker entry point** switched to enhanced architecture
- **Wrangler configuration** updated with service bindings
- **Migration scripts** created for deployment and rollback

## 🔧 Deployment Commands

### **Enhanced Architecture Deployment**
```bash
# Deploy all services to production
npm run deploy:enhanced

# Deploy to staging
npm run deploy:enhanced:staging

# Deploy to development
npm run deploy:enhanced:dev

# Manual deployment script
./scripts/deploy-enhanced-architecture.sh production

## 📊 Health Monitoring

### **Health Check Endpoint**
```
GET /health
```

**Response includes:**
- Overall system health status
- Individual service health metrics
- Circuit breaker states
- Response times and error rates
- Service uptime statistics

### **Circuit Breaker Protection**
- **Failure threshold:** 5 failures trigger circuit open
- **Recovery timeout:** 60 seconds before retry attempt
- **Half-open testing:** Gradual service recovery

## 🔄 Breaking Changes Summary

### **API Compatibility**
- **✅ No breaking changes** to external API endpoints
- **✅ Same request/response formats** maintained
- **✅ Authentication** remains unchanged
- **✅ Frontend compatibility** preserved

### **Internal Changes**
- **Worker entry point** switched from `api-handlers.ts` to `enhanced-api-router.ts`
- **Service communication** now uses RPC instead of internal method calls
- **Configuration** updated to include service bindings and Durable Objects
- **Deployment process** enhanced with multi-service coordination

## 🎯 Benefits Achieved

### **Performance**
