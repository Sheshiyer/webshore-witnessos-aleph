Light Quanta Density: Instead of "Amount of light quanta," you might want to focus on the density of light patterns in the PIP image. This could involve calculating the average number of light patterns (fringes) per unit area (e.g., per square pixel).

Normalized Area Analysis: In PIP, you could also consider normalizing the area of interest to a reference area, similar to the "Normalized area" metric in GDV. This could involve calculating the ratio of the area covered by light patterns in the region of interest to the total area of the region.

Average Intensity: "Intensity" in GDV could be related to the brightness or intensity of the light patterns in the PIP image. You could calculate the average intensity of light patterns in the region of interest.

 Inner Noise Analysis: In PIP, the concept of "inner noise" might be analogous to the amount of noise or fluctuations in the captured light patterns within a specific region. You could analyze the variability or fluctuations in light patterns to characterize this.

Energy Analysis: "Energy" in GDV refers to the energy of light emitted. In PIP, you could calculate the cumulative energy carried by the light patterns within the area of interest.

Entropy and Form Coefficient: While GDV uses EC and FC for contour analysis, in PIP, you could explore similar metrics by analyzing the complexity of light pattern contours. Entropy could reflect the irregularity or complexity of light patterns, while a form coefficient could be devised based on the relationship between contour length and the covered area.  Analyzing the non-linear properties of PIP images and videos can provide valuable insights into the underlying dynamics of the captured light patterns.

 Here are some additional metrics that you can calculate from PIP images for analyzing their non-linear properties:

Fractal Dimension: Fractal dimension is a measure of the complexity of a shape or pattern. Calculating the fractal dimension of the light patterns in PIP images can provide information about their self-similarity and intricacy.

Hurst Exponent: The Hurst exponent characterizes the long-term memory of a time series. Applied to PIP videos or time-varying images, it can help reveal whether the light patterns exhibit self-similarity over different time scales, indicating non-linear behaviors.

Lyapunov Exponent: Lyapunov exponents quantify the rate of divergence of nearby trajectories in a dynamical system. By analyzing the behavior of trajectories corresponding to different pixel values in a PIP image, you can estimate the degree of chaotic or non-linear behavior.

 Correlation Dimension: The correlation dimension measures how the number of points in a phase space increases with the size of the space. Applied to PIP patterns, it can provide insights into the underlying attractors and the dimensionality of the system generating the patterns.

  Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA): DFA is used to analyze the presence of long-term correlations in time series data. When applied to time-varying PIP images, DFA can help identify power-law relationships and non-linear behaviors.

 Bifurcation Analysis: If you have a sequence of PIP images that represent a changing system, you can perform bifurcation analysis to identify critical points where the behavior of the system changes qualitatively.

Recurrence Plot Analysis: Recurrence plots visualize the recurrence of states in a dynamical system. Applying recurrence plot analysis to PIP images can help uncover periodic or quasi-periodic behaviors.  

Non-linear Mapping Techniques: Techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Independent Component Analysis (ICA), and Nonlinear Dimensionality Reduction (e.g., t-SNE) can reveal hidden patterns and structures within PIP images that might indicate non-linear relationships. 

 Entropy Measures: Various entropy measures (e.g., Shannon entropy, Approximate Entropy) can provide insights into the complexity and randomness of PIP patterns, aiding in the characterisation of non-linear behaviors. 

 Body Symmetry Analysis: Assess bilateral symmetry of light patterns within left and right halves of segmented body using correlation metrics. Loss of symmetry may signal issues.  Segmented Contour Complexity: Evaluate the complexity of the body region contour using metrics like fractal dimension. Higher complexity may relate to specific health states. 

 Light Pattern Regularity: Assess the uniformity of spacing between light patterns in the body region using Fourier transforms or autocorrelation. More uniform spacing indicates more coherent emission.  

Non-linear Regression: Applying non-linear regression techniques to PIP data can help model and quantify the relationships between different variables within the image. - Now we have all these parameters that can be measured in the PIP image.

As with other metrics, it might be necessary to empirically test and adjust these weightings using actual PIP images, possibly utilizing expert judgment, to ensure that they accurately capture the intended aspects of the images. Combining these with the previously mentioned scores can give a comprehensive understanding of both the spatial patterns and the color information within the PIP image.

Here is one approach to combine the various metrics from the PIP image analysis into 3 summary scores for Energy, Symmetry/Balance, and Coherence:

Energy Score:

- Light Quanta Density - 30% weight
- Normalized Area - 20% weight

Calculate each metric first. Then combine them in a weighted average based on the percentages above. Higher values imply higher energy emission in the PIP image.

Symmetry/Balance Score:

- Body Symmetry Analysis - 50% weight
- Segmented Contour Complexity - 30% weight
- Light Pattern Regularity - 20% weight

Combine these metrics using a weighted average. Lower values indicate more asymmetry and imbalance in the PIP emissions.

Coherence Score:

- Hurst Exponent - 25% weight

2. Color Entropy - Measure the randomness/complexity in color distribution using entropy metrics like Shannon Entropy. Higher values indicate more heterogeneous color. 

3. Color Correlation - Compute correlation between intensity values in different color channels. High correlation implies more consistent coloring.

4. Spectral Power Distribution - Take the Fourier transform of the color channels to analyze the spectral power distribution. Reveals dominant and subtle hues.

5. Color Coherence - Calculate the length and area of connected regions per color channel. Assess degree of localized coherence.

6. Color Energy - Integrate the pixel intensities across color channels in regions of interest. Relates to vigor of emissions. 

7. Color Symmetry - Determine similarity between left and right halves of image using color correlation metrics.

9. Dominant Wavelength/Hue - Use histogram analysis to find the most dominant wavelength or hue in the image.

10. Color Perimeter - Measure length of borders between different color regions. More intricate perimeters indicate complex boundaries.

The key is to extract metrics related to distribution, coherence, contrasts, symmetry and spectral power from the color data. These could give vital insights into the PIP energy fields along with the pattern analysis. Please let me know if you would like me to elaborate on any of these suggested color metrics!

Here are two additional suggested scores for color analysis in PIP images, along with example formulas:

- Spectral Power Distribution (SPD) - 30% weight
- Color Gamut Area (GA) - 25% weight 
- Color Entropy (H) - 20% weight
- Dominant Wavelength Intensity (Iλdom) - 25% weight

Color Vitality = 0.3*SPD + 0.25*GA + 0.2*H + 0.25*Iλdom

Higher scores imply greater color vitality and activation in the PIP image.

5. Color Coherence Score 

This measures how coherent and structured the color patterns are:

- Color Symmetry (S) - 30% weight
- Color Auto-correlation (AC) - 25% weight

- Color Clustering Homogeneity (CH) - 25% weight  

Color Coherence = 0.3*S + 0.25*AC + 0.2*FD + 0.25*CH

Higher scores suggest more coherent and organized color distributions in the image.

The exact weightings can be adjusted as needed. The formulas provide an example for combining the various color metrics into aggregated scores that summarize the overall color properties and trends in the PIP image. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional suggestions!
